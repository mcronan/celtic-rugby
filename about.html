          <h2> Our Story </h2>
          <p> Whilst captaining the Ohio State Rugby team, Irish native Luke Hickey saw first hand the vast athletic potential bubbling below the surface in the  rapidly growing United States rugby scene.
</p>
<p>
Inspired by the love for the game he found Stateside and its followers’ thirst for knowledge, Luke’s conversations back home with Connacht Rugby star and friend Eoin McKeon, quickly led to the formation, with group tour specialist Stephen Tummon, of Celtic Rugby Tours.
</p>
<p>
Celtic Rugby Tours delivers specifically tailored tours for High School and College Rugby programmes to specially selected rugby hotbeds in Ireland.
</p>
<p>
Each individually designed tour will allow visiting players and coaches up close and personal sessions with Irish professional rugby stars plus carefully selected games versus local clubs suited to your standard. 
</p>
<p>
There’ll be plenty of chances to enjoy the famous Irish hospitality and “craic”, including attendance at either an Irish international fixture or another professional match and plenty of other activities led by Stephen who has brought over 200 successful tours to Ireland.
